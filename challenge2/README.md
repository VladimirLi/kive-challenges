# Emoji Interpretation Challenge

An interesting [demo on emoji search using Deep Learning](https://deepmoji.mit.edu/), and also an [implementation in Pytorch](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji). NOTE, this is not used in the solution, as it would requre to be run on a server.

In this solution I am using `fuse` for fuzzy search of emojies. The list of emojies is fetched from [emojilib](https://unpkg.com/browse/emojilib@3.0.4/dist/emoji-en-US.json).

## To run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
